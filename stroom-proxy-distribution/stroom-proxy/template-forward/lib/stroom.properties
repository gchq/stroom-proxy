# Optionally supply a template for naming the files in the repository. This can be specified using multiple replacement variables.
# The standard template is '${pathId}/{$id}' and will be used if this property is not set.
# This pattern will produce the following paths for the following identities:
#   1 = 001.zip
#   100 = 100.zip
#   1000 = 001/001000.zip
#   10000 = 010/010000.zip
#   100000 = 100/100000.zip
#
# Other replacement variables can be used to in the template including header meta data parameters (e.g. '${feed}') and time based parameters (e.g. '${year}').
# Replacement variables that cannot be resolved will be output as '_'.
# Please ensure that all templates include the '${id}' replacement variable at the start of the file name, failure to do this will result in an invalid repository.
